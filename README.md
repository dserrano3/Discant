Discant

<p>Programming language, designed to teach kids how to code, it has features that makes it easier to code, so kids are focused on learning how to code and not the syntaxis of the language.<br>
For example, it works if you forget to use a semicolon, or if you write False or false; and other features that you can see in the example</p>

<p>You can help us forking the code and adding feautures, or translating it to other languages </p>
<p>The language currently supports english and spanish for the reserved words, for example if can be written as si or while as mientras, this can usefull if you are teaching to people who don't speak english </p>
